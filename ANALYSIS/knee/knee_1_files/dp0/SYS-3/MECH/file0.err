 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.141   TIME= 17:51:54
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.266   TIME= 17:51:54
 Material number 59 (used by element 36584) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.828   TIME= 17:51:54
 It is highly recommended to set KEYOPT(10)=0 (update contact stiffness  
 at each iteration) in order to achieve better convergence.              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.828   TIME= 17:51:54
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.828   TIME= 17:51:54
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 70212).                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.828   TIME= 17:51:54
 Certain contact elements (for example 43192 & 43115) overlap with       
 other.                                                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.359   TIME= 17:51:57
 An internal boundary condition has been imposed on node 70215, degree   
 of freedom 1 of the element 36584.  This may cause an ill-condition     
 for the solver.  Please check all MPC based elements having boundary    
 conditions.

 An internal boundary condition has been imposed on node 70215, degree   
 of freedom 2 of the element 36584.  This may cause an ill-condition

 An internal boundary condition has been imposed on node 70215, degree   
 of freedom 4 of the element 36584.  This may cause an ill-condition     
 for the solver.  Please check all MPC based elements having boundary

 An internal boundary condition has been imposed on node 70215, degree   
 of freedom 5 of the element 36584.  This may cause an ill-condition     
 for the solver.  Please check all MPC based elements having boundary    
 conditions.

 An internal boundary condition has been imposed on node 70215, degree   
 of freedom 6 of the element 36584.  This may cause an ill-condition     
 for the solver.  Please check all MPC based elements having boundary    
 conditions.                                                             

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       6.156   TIME= 17:51:59
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.               

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =       8.078   TIME= 17:52:01
 Element 22125 (type = 15, SOLID187) (and maybe other elements) has      
 become highly distorted.  Excessive distortion of elements is usually   
 a symptom indicating the need for corrective action elsewhere.  Try     
 ramping the load up instead of step applying the load (KBC,1).  You     
 may need to improve your mesh to obtain elements with better aspect     
 ratios.  Also consider the behavior of materials, contact pairs,        
 and/or constraint equations.  Please rule out other root causes of      
 this failure before attempting rezoning or nonlinear adaptive           
 solutions.  If this message appears in the first iteration of first     
 substep, be sure to run shape checking of elements.                     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       8.078   TIME= 17:52:01
 The unconverged solution (identified as time 1 substep 999999) is       
 output for analysis debug purposes.  Results should not be used for     
 any other purpose.
