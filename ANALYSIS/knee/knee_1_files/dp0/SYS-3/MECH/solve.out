 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver   
 data.

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =       8.078   TIME= 17:52:01
 Element 22125 (type = 15, SOLID187) (and maybe other elements) has      
 become highly distorted.  Excessive distortion of elements is usually   
 a symptom indicating the need for corrective action elsewhere.  Try     
 ramping the load up instead of step applying the load (KBC,1).  You     
 may need to improve your mesh to obtain elements with better aspect     
 ratios.  Also consider the behavior of materials, contact pairs,        
 and/or constraint equations.  Please rule out other root causes of      
 this failure before attempting rezoning or nonlinear adaptive           
 solutions.  If this message appears in the first iteration of first     
 substep, be sure to run shape checking of elements.
