 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.875   TIME= 00:34:50
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.875   TIME= 00:34:50
 Material number 40 (used by element 15780) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.266   TIME= 00:34:50
 It is highly recommended to set KEYOPT(10)=0 (update contact stiffness  
 at each iteration) in order to achieve better convergence.              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.281   TIME= 00:34:50
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.281   TIME= 00:34:50
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 56361).                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.281   TIME= 00:34:50
 Certain contact elements (for example 21270 & 21257) overlap with       
 other.                                                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.938   TIME= 00:34:51
 An internal boundary condition has been imposed on node 56375, degree   
 of freedom 1 of the element 15795.  This may cause an ill-condition     
 for the solver.  Please check all MPC based elements having boundary    
 conditions.
