 *WARNING*: Node 56362 has been used on different contact pairs (real ID 
 39 & 26).  These two pairs will be merged.  Please check the model      
 carefully.                                                              
 *WARNING*: Some rigid target elements (e.g.21207) in real constant set  
 26 overlap with other MPC/Lagrange based elements (e.g.15777) in real   
 constant set 39 which can cause overconstraint.

 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver   
 data.                                                                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.172   TIME= 00:34:51
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or
