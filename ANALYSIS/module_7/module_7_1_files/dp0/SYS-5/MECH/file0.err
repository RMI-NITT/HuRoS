 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.

 Material number 53 (used by element 133276) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.812   TIME= 23:32:56
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.812   TIME= 23:32:56
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 267005).                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.812   TIME= 23:32:56
 Certain contact elements (for example 133426 & 133409) overlap with     
 other.
