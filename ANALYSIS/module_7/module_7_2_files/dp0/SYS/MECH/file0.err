 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.109   TIME= 23:08:28
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.266   TIME= 23:08:28
 Material number 137 (used by element 68297) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.266   TIME= 23:08:28
 No constraints have been defined using the D command.                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.703   TIME= 23:08:28
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.703   TIME= 23:08:28
 Certain contact elements (for example 71103 & 70104) overlap with       
 other.                                                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       8.078   TIME= 23:08:35
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.               

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     426.812   TIME= 23:15:57

 Solution not converged at time 1 (load step 1 substep 1).               
  Run terminated.                                                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     843.953   TIME= 23:23:33
 The unconverged solution (identified as time 10 substep 999999) is      
 output for analysis debug purposes.  Results should not be used for     
 any other purpose.
