 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver   
 data.                                                                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       8.078   TIME= 23:08:35
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or

 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver   
 data.

 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that
